Traxs / WorkOrder PDF – Next tasks

Version: 1.0.x
Focus area: WorkOrder_PDF line items

1) Fix layout so each group is:
   - Row 1: line item table row
   - Row 2: single image row: [mockup] [art front] [art back] [etc.]
2) Group by parent SKU instead of vendor+color to remove duplicate descriptions.
3) SVG/EPS/AI:
   - Conversion via Imagick blob is working in logs.
   - Confirm those temp PNGs are actually drawn in the image row.
